# Fork of the original Scylla PCB

My goal is to adapt the pcb of the main part and the thumbclusters to use hotswap sockets. In particular I plan to use Kailh MX Hotswap sockets with salvaged MX Blues. They are not clear so the per key RGB wont work, but I will keep the option open as I go forward.
I will try to post updates and pictures of the progress once I order the parts.
